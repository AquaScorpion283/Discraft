# Discraft
Discraft is a useful tool when making a Discord bot that relates to linking usernames.
You can also use this on webhooks to link the In game chat to a specific channel.
The tool is not currently out but it will be as soon as possible. This feature also will be able to do many other things including using code to make a user to join a game.
